# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build Neon Genesis, a platform for sharing and exploring sustainable ideas with investment interest tracking.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for sign up and login
- Create backend data model for ideas/posts with title, description, category (environmental, disaster-related, or sustainable infrastructure/business), author, timestamp, and virtual prototype information
- Build post creation interface with form fields for title, description, category selection, and virtual prototype content
- Implement Instagram-like feed view with card layout and infinite scroll/pagination
- Add category filtering to browse ideas by type
- Implement like system with toggle functionality and like counts
- Build commenting system for authenticated users to add and view comments
- Create three-tier investment rating system with diamond (100-300 dollars), blue sapphire (300-500 dollars), and red ruby (500-700 dollars) badges
- Design attractive Instagram-inspired UI with vibrant neon accents, modern typography, card layouts, and smooth animations
- Display generated hero banner and gem rating icons from frontend/public/assets/generated

**User-visible outcome:** Users can authenticate, create and share sustainable ideas with virtual prototypes, browse and filter posts by category, like and comment on ideas, and indicate investment interest using a three-tier gem rating system, all within a modern neon-themed interface.
